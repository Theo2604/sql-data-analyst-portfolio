# Customer Churn & Retention Analysis (PostgreSQL)

## Objective
Analyze customer transaction behavior to identify churned customers and measure retention.

## Tools
- PostgreSQL
- SQL (CTEs, subqueries, JOINs, window functions)

## Key Metrics
- Active vs churned customers
- Customer lifetime
- Monthly retention
- Churn rate

## Techniques Used
- LEFT JOIN
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Date calculations
- Window functions (LAG)
- Aggregations

## Insights
- Customers with frequent early transactions have longer lifetimes
- Churn is highest within the first 3 months
- Retention declines month over month

## Next Steps
- Cohort-based retention analysis
- Segment churn by customer value
- Visualize retention curves
